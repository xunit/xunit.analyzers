## Editing the documentation

The documentation is built using GitHub Pages' Jekyll build system. Familiarize yourself with the [GitHub Pages documentation](https://help.github.com/categories/customizing-github-pages/) first, including how to run the Jekyll pipeline locally.

The rule descriptions are located in <a href="_rules/">_rules/</a>. They get combined with the layouts to produce the final output.
